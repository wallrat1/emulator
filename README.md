# Shell Emulator GUI

Shell Emulator GUI is a Python-based virtual shell environment with a graphical user interface (GUI). It provides a simulation of basic shell commands such as `ls`, `cd`, `uname`, and more, running on a virtual file system (`tar` archive). This project is designed for educational purposes and exploring the basics of shell operations.

## Features

- **Virtual File System**: Uses a `.tar` archive as the file system, enabling navigation and file operations in a virtualized environment.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Built with `tkinter` for an interactive shell-like experience.
- **Command Support**:
  - `ls`: Lists directory contents.
  - `cd`: Changes the current directory.
  - `uname`: Displays system information.
  - `tail`: Shows the last 10 lines of a file.
  - `tac`: Displays file contents in reverse order.
  - `cal`: Prints the current month's calendar.
  - `date`: Prints the current date and time.
  - `exit`: Closes the shell emulator.
  - `clear`: Clears the output area.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shell-emulator-gui.git
   cd shell-emulator-gui
Install dependencies: Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed. The project uses standard Python libraries, so no additional packages are required.

Create the configuration file: Create a file named config.ini in the project directory with the following content:

ini
–ö–æ–ø–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –∫–æ–¥
[user]
name = your_username

[system]
hostname = your_hostname

[filesystem]
path = virtual_fs.tar
Prepare the virtual file system:

Create a tar archive (e.g., virtual_fs.tar) with your desired files and directories:
bash
–ö–æ–ø–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –∫–æ–¥
tar -cf virtual_fs.tar your_folder/
Usage
Run the script using Python:

bash
–ö–æ–ø–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –∫–æ–¥
python shell_emulator.py
How It Works
Virtual File System:

Loads a .tar archive and maps its structure to a virtual file system.
Commands:

Commands are processed by parsing user input and executing corresponding methods.
GUI:

Built using tkinter with a scrollable text area for output and an entry field for user commands.
Example Commands
List contents:

bash
–ö–æ–ø–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –∫–æ–¥
ls
Change directory:

bash
–ö–æ–ø–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –∫–æ–¥
cd subdir
Print system information:

bash
–ö–æ–ø–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –∫–æ–¥
uname
View the last 10 lines of a file:

bash
–ö–æ–ø–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –∫–æ–¥
tail file.txt
View file contents in reverse order:

bash
–ö–æ–ø–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –∫–æ–¥
tac file.txt
Display the calendar:

bash
–ö–æ–ø–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –∫–æ–¥
cal
Print the current date:

bash
–ö–æ–ø–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –∫–æ–¥
date
Exit the emulator:

bash
–ö–æ–ø–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –∫–æ–¥
exit
Customization
Configuration:

Modify config.ini to change user name, hostname, or the path to the virtual file system.
Adding Commands:

Extend the process_command method to add new commands and their functionality.
